b2luigi
=======

``b2luigi`` is a helper package constructed around ``luigi``, that helps you schedule working packages (so called tasks)
locally or on the batch system.
It includes a simple dependency management system, an easy to user interface and build-in support for the LSF queue
on the KEKCC.

Please find more information in the :ref:`quick-start-label`.

If you find any bugs or want to improve the documentation, please send me a merge request on github_.

Unfortunately, this project is still unfinished and in beta.
You can help me by working with one of the todo items described in :ref:`todo-label`.
